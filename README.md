# Solutions to LeetCode Problems

Since the solutions are availabe on the site, and discussions often include answers, I'm not revealing anything by making this repository public. It consists of 4 different projects. Clone
this repository, then open one of the subdirectories with the appropriate IDE. `./leetcode-java` and 
`./leetcode-scala` can be opened in IntelliJ. `./leetcode-python` can be opened in Visual Studio Code. Of course you'll want to add Python extensions, and configure `pytest` as the testing framework.
I worked on `./leetcode-ruby` using JetBrains' RubyMine.
